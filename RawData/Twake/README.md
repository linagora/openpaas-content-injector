#### ChannelTitle
This file contains the titles given to the channels added in the Twake workspace.

#### Dialogues
This files contains the database of the dialogs injected in Twake. A dialog is always beetween two people, for convenience. Each line corresponds to a replica.

Each dialog is separated from others by a linebreak, so to add a dialog you just have to add it at the end of the file, with a mandatory linebreak at its end.
