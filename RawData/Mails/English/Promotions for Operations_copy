<h5>Dear {receiver},</h5><br>
<p>I worlked with Harold Gasset, Linda Black and Bill Mall today on their input for proposed promotions for Operations.  {in_copy}  has the recommended names and salary increases.  Do you need anything else?  Description of their respoinsibilities, rationale for promotion recommendation, etc.?  Let me know.</p>
<br>
<p>I mentioned to {in_copy} that letters had been given to both Harold Gassett and Bill Superty in late November or December stating that they would be promoted from Director to Senior Director at the first of the year.  We have Harold covered, but with the change in Bill Superty's reporting relationship, I want to be certain that his promotion doesn't fall through the cracks.  {in_copy} was somehow unaware of these letters, although they were prepared by HR.  As you review the entire list of proposed promotions, please be check to make sure that Bill Superty's name was submitted by Scott Neal for a promotion.</p>
<br>
<p>Thanks.</p>
