<h5>Hi team,</h5><br>
<p>You will all be getting an invitation to a project greentlight meeting.  I would like to get together and discuss the logistics of what the committee will do.  Please think about: </p><br> 
<p>1.  How often we should meet<br> 2.  How to hold people accountable for projects<br> 3.  Setting up timelines for where the committee thinks we should be at benchmark times.  (maybe each quarter end)<br> 4.  Reporting progress to Karen and Nick Kane <br></p>
<p>I am sure there are many other things which I have left out, which you guys may want to add.  I appreciate everyone' s attention to this project both now and going forward.</p>
