<h5>Dear {receiver} ,</h5><br> 
<p>In the event that a manual payment needs to be sent, I need your approval to set up {in_copy} , my lead in London, and Mary Chillermip, settlements lead for EGM for them to sign off.  As we are moving to replicate the EGM payment process in London for EIM, utilizing EGM resources, this should only be a temporary need because EIM's payment templates are not fully set up in SAP yet.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Please let me know if you need any further information.</p>
