<h5>Good morning {receiver},</h5><br> 
<p>Sara Taprik suggested that I contact you for assistance in pulling together a 'dummy' DASH and past deal capital budgeting information.  the Company University Affairs, the Xcelerator and the Recruiting department are collaborating with the McIntire School of Commerce (University of Virginia) on a year long project where 80 Commerce students will research a topic assigned to them by the Company.  At this point, the Xcelerator has suggested research on the 'Decentralization of Energy Distribution/Distributive Generation', and to this end, we are responding to faculty requests for broad-based industry and the Company-specific information.  Bill Laygir, Associate Dean for the Graduate Programs has requested any type of capital budgeting information that we could provide to help the students 'get a better feel for' how the Company structures its deals.</p> 
<br> 
<p>I am by no means a financial guru or whiz, so I'm not sure any of this will make sense to you but here are the buzz words he mentioned during a conference call: </p><br> 
<p>   cash flows $ required needed cost of capital time adjustments (for capital) </p><br> 
<p>Is there anything else we can give them (outside of a dummy DASH)?  We will be entering in a CA with the school/students.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Please let me know at your earliest convenience.</p>
