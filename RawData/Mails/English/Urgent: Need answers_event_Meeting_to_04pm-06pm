<h5>Hi {receiver}</h5><br> 
<p>What's the story on this one?  Who can best answer the four questions posed by Lea?  How soon can we have answers?  Interestingly, I have a 4:00 PM meeting today with Bob Roonny, Paul Potter, Lea Razzy, Bob Fradboard and Cristin Crackett (rescheduled from last Friday re: Project Greenlight, due to Roonny's schedule).  I would like to be more informed than they are at 4:00. <br> Thanks.</p>
