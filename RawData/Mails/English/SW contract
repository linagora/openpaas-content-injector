<h5>Dear {receiver} ,</h5><br> 
<p>Thanks for the fax on SW Contract.</p> 
<br> 
<p>We are meeting with Harry Black, Bernard Lofey & Ernest Zub on April 27th to discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  How much electrical capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main contacts at SW?</p> 
<br> 
<p>We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.</p> 
<br> 
<p>As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated.</p>
