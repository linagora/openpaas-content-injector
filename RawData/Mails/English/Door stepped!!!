<p>It's official, we are being door stepped. The Houston plan is to do all of Power and all of the Structures (although when I spoke to Jane she seemed a little unsure of her plan for structures). Also from what Jane said the Gas door step will be following shortly.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Jane and Karen Rubrecht aim to be here for the whole week starting first thing on Monday the 5th. EAS here are already in the loop as they have been various conversations. Obviously with all the additional work we are being asked to do at the moment something will have to give. I aim to speak to Peter Lombrey to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to get him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and which by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid duplication. In addition, we will also need to make commercial aware of a reduced capacity to perform analytical tasks as well as model review and gap analysis work etc.</p>
