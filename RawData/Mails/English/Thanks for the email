<h5>Dear {receiver} ,</h5><br> 
<p>I got your email.  I didn't have time to finish it.  I will read it this weekend and ask my dad about the a/c's.  I am glad you are enjoying the job.  This weekend I will mark up the lease and rules.  If I didn't mention this when I was there, the 4th is a paid holiday for you and Jane.</p> 
<p>Have a good weekend and I will talk to you next week.</p>
