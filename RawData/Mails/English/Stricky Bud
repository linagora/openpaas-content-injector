<h5>Dear {receiver} ,</h5><br> 
<p>I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to John Striky Bud.  They have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you give me a basis for the period : <br> 
<p>Sept-2020 - May 31, 2026 Sept-2020 - May 31, 2028 <br> 
<p>Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread be on these terms.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Thanks, <br> <div class="openpaas-signature"> -- <br>
