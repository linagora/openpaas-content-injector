<h5>Dear {receiver} ,</h5><br>
<p> With regard to Jane Mokendall, I would like to promote her to commercial manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to others in that category at year end.</p>
<br>
<p> Martin O'Sally on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Jane.</p>
<p>Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Jane.</p>
<br>
<p> Let me know if there are any issues.</p>
