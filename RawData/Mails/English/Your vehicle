<h5>Dear {receiver} ,</h5><br>
<p> I understood your number one priority was to deal with your vehicle situation.  You need to take care of it this week.  Melany can't hold the tenants to a standard (vehicles must be in running order with valid stickers) if the staff doesn't live up to it.  If you decide to buy a small truck and you want to list me as an employer for credit purposes, I will vouch for your income.</p>
