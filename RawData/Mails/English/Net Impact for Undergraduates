<h5>Hi!</h5><br>
<p>If I were you, I would talk to Lea and let her know that Ben is the point person as it relates to currently handling this matter and that we will trust that she will keep him fully informed and involved.  We are glad that she is there to provide some continuity on historical data, but all historical data and forward actions must be confirmed with Ben.  Let me know if you would like me to underscore this with Lea, and I will be glad to.  Might be a good idea to send a note to Paul, Jean and David stating that legal has named Lea as the point person, but that for appropriate continuity and execution that Ben must be fully involved - and that you have asked Lea to make that part of her responsibility.  Copy Lea on the note.</p>
