<h5>Dear {receiver} ,</h5><br>
<p>We are currently back-testing the storage model.</p>
<p>The enclosed version contains deltas and decision variable.</p>
<br>
<p>You mentioned that you have resources to run the model. Please do so.</p>
<p>This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the model.</p>
<br>
<p>I am going to distribute an article by Linagora, an software vendor.</p>
<p>The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation very well.  The the Company Research storage model  is a lot like that, although implementation may be different.</p>
<br>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions.</p>
