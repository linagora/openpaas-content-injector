<h5>Dear {receiver} ,</h5><br>
<p> I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.</p>
<p>The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.</p>
