<h5>Dear {receiver} ,</h5><br> 
<p> Here is a rentroll for this week.  The one you sent for 11/24 looked good.</p> 
<p>It seems like most people are paying on time.  Did you rent an efficiency to the elderly woman on a fixed income?  Go ahead a use your judgement on the rent prices for the vacant units.  If you need to lower the rent by $10 or $20 to get things full, go ahead.</p> 
<br> 
<p> I will be out of the office on Thursday.  I will talk to you on Friday.</p>
