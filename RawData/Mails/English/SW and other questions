<h5>Dear {receiver} ,</h5><br> 
<p>John McMahon and I met with SW Company this morning.  They were polite regarding asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a weather product.</p> 
<br> 
<p>As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other candidates; however, John McMahon and I are developing a coverage strategy to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we implement our strategy in California.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to systematically identify and work through all the candidates.</p>
