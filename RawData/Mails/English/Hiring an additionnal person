<h5>Dear {receiver},</h5><br> 
<p>Steven would like me to hire an additional person to strictly focus on his deals across all commodities.  He says that his people don't have time to look at these reports.  Also,  Ilan Ramig wants 11 new physical books on the east region.  This will require at least two more risk people,  and probably two new OA people.  We told him that yesterday,  and he was fine with that.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Haven't had the chance to look at the UT presentation yet.  That will make good airplane material tomorrow.  If I make any changes I will try to fax pages to you after Jack picks me up at the airport tomorrow.  If I don't make chanages, I will call you Friday afternoon after landing and let you know that.  My schedule has been really full here, but very productive.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Thanks for your comments.  I must admit, I am really excited about the promotion.  We can talk next week about what I hope to accomplish during this next year and where my major focus will be.  It will be helpful for you to know and understand that as we work together to make that happen.  I am certainly glad that you are here - my flight to London reminded me of your arrival about this time last year as I was heading to London.  Luckily a different reason for the trip this year, but still hectic.  I expect it to be a busy year.</p> 
<br> 
<p>You will notice that I have blocked some times on my calendar to get reviews written and delivered.  Target is to be finished  by the end of January .</p> 
<br> 
<p>I will talk with you on Friday afternoon and see you on Monday.</p>
