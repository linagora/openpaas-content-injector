<h5>Hi!</h5><br> 
<p>I know you are both busy.  Lots of push back from London on Doorstep Reviews.  I recognize that our world is pretty crazy right now.  However, it is London's normal stance to push back on the reviews and work to the change the timing.  I think that they view being a subject of a Doorstep review as an elective procedure on their part.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Next week I will follow up with you to get your thoughts on Doorstep efforts during the 4th quarter.  Wanted you to see my reply to Lernfey below.</p>
