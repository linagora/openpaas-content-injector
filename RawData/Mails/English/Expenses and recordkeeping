<h5>Dear {receiver} ,</h5><br>
<p> Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.</p>
<br>
<p> First, I want to implement the following changes: <br>
<p>  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.</p>
<p>  2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily</p>  
<p>  3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank </p>
<p>  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic operations.</p>
<br>
<p> Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all the checks since Jan. 1.</p>
<p> When you open the file, go to the "Checkbook" tab and look at the yellow highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.</p>
<p> Please gather receipts so we can discuss.</p>
