<p>Thanks for sending the attachments.  Didn't have a second to review them last week, but this week should be more manageable.  I was in Austin this weekend to celebrate my parents' 50th wedding anniversary.  Had the chance to hold and rock my new niece who is now 9 weeks old.  I think that I failed to mention while you were here that her name is Elizabeth.  Such a doll.<br></p>
